Building the code:
There is only a single mex/cpp file included in this package that can be build with the MATLAB function "mex". The steps are:
mex -setup C++                                                                 
mex SR_scale_Hadamard.cpp ("scale" is the upscaling factor,e.g. mex SR_2_Hadamard.cpp ). We provide a pre-compiled file "SR_2_Hadamard.mexw64" for Windows (64 bit).

Using the code:
The file "DC_demo.m" is the demo usage of the proposed algorithm. However the file contains one test image (MRI) c03_1.bmp. The remaining test images can be download from

The training data can be download from above dataset links. The traing data should be kept in a folder "Source1" in the directory. The training dataset used in our paper can be generated by file "create_train_data.m". 

The modcrop function is from the source code of: C. Dong, C. C. Loy, K. He, and X. Tang. Learning a deep convolutional network for image super-resolution. In European Conference on Computer Vision, pages 184¨C199. Springer, 2014.

The learned mapping models as well as the decision tree for scaling factor 2 can be directly used for SR reconstruction. 

For demo purpose, we have presented results for scale factor 2 in given code. The results for scale factor 4 can be obtained by going through above given instructions. The quantitative results are compared using psnr & ssim for this study.
